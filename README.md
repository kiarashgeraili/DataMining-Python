# DataMining-Python

In this repository, we aim to illustrate the fundamentals of python and also introducing some important libraries for the task of data mining.
This content is based on a course by Adel Mohammad pour and his teaching assistant Vahid Mahzoon. In this course, we read "Discovering Knowledge in Data-An Introduction to Data Science," and based on this book, and Data Mining approaches, we create some projects and solve them in Jupyter-notebook environment.
If you are a native Persian speaker, you can use this link "https://www.aparat.com/playlist/347907" to access to Vahid Mahzoon's teaching Python for Data Mining. Notice that in this repository, I change the original codes to make it more useful for students who want to learn python. For example, I used much more -and in some cases much complicated- examples which there are not in those videos.
Finally, if there is any question or suggestion, you can contact me.
