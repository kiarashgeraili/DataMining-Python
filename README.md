# DataMining-Python

In this repository, we aim to illustrate the fundamentals of python and also introducing some important libraries for the task of data mining.
This content is based on a course by Adel Mohammad pour and his teaching assistant Vahid Mahzoon. In this course, we read "Discovering Knowledge in Data-An Introduction to Data Science" a book written by Laroses, and based on this course, we create this repository. first of all we try to intoduce the fundamentals of python, numpy and pandas libraries. in the next section we implement Data Mining approaches and create some projects and solve them in Jupyter-notebook environment.

If you are a native Persian speaker, you can use this link "https://www.aparat.com/playlist/347907" to access to Vahid Mahzoon's teaching Python for Data Mining. Notice that in this repository, I change the original codes written by mahzoon to make it more useful for students who want to learn python. For example, I used much more -and in some cases much complicated- examples which there are not in those videos.
Finally, if there is any question or suggestion, you can contact me by my email.
